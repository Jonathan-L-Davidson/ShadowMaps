Difficult to give direct fedback as work is underway on abstract texture loading
Baased on what I can see this appears to be going well
This feedback is based off of reading the code rather than testing the application

### Rendering
Good use of object management to handle arbritary meshes, this seems good and I would like to see it functioning with OBJs/Hardcoded equally

### Lighting
Light calculations look correct and combine texturing as expected 
I'd recommend considering your specularmap implementation as part of the texture loading
Progress on this seems very good, I'd like to see a functional application to check the output properly
